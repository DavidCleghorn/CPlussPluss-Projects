// Division Sales Data

//  Completed by David Cleghorn on 3/25/22.
// Status: Complete
// This program  determines which of a companyâ€™s four divisions
// had the greatest sales for a quarter. It includes two functions
// that are called by main:  getSales and findHighest.

#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

//create 2 function prototypes to get sales
//and get highest selling division
double getSales(string);

//This function will gather sales data from
//the different divisions. It will call the
//other functions and store the sales data

    //call function 4 times and pass the names of the divisions
    //to get back the sales numbers and store values

    SW = getSales("Southwest");
    
   //pass sales data to function that determines highest selling division
    findHighest(NE, SE, NW, SW);

//This function will show the different divisions and ask the user
//to enter the sales for each one. It will validate if it is > 0
//and if not, it will ask for the user to re-enter amount.
